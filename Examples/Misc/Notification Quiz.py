'''
This is mostly a demonstration of the new local notification capabilities in Pythonista 3.3, that allow you to schedule notifications with custom action buttons (quiz answers in this case), image attachments (not used here), and more.

The example also shows how to query a simple web API (Open Trivia DB) using Python.

As a challenge, you could try modifying this example to show one question per hour or per day. Or try to include a quiz category icon in the notification...
