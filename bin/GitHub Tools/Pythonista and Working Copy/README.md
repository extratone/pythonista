### Please try to share a file or repo from Working Copy to Pythonista (or Editorial) and you will get an "Install a Workflow" message...

[Appex script](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/ios/appex.html) that enables Pythonista to download a git repo, file, or folder from a share sheet from the Working Copy app

Pre requisites:

* [Working Copy app for iOS](https://workingcopyapp.com)

Workflow:
