Access Samba/Windows-Shares
=========================

Small ui example: upload/download/rename/delete files or make/remove directories. Use at your own risk, this worked with my mini wifi router usb share. I'm not responsible for data loses (please always backup your data:).

First you need to download the impacket python module: impacket-0.9.12.tar.gz
Then extract \impacket-0.9.12\impacket\ to the side-packages directory.
And you also need a copy of ntpath.py in your side-package directory.

The active window is red, so buttons belong either to the local or to the remote side.
