The other day I was going to work on a program on my iPad, while sitting next to my laptop. It seemed silly to be writing on an on-screen keyboard when I had a nice keyboard right next to me. Codea has a feature called AirCode, which starts up a web server on the iPad which lets you connect using a computer and write code in a browser and save it to the iPad when you're done. I made something like this using bottle for [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/). It doesn't work on my iPad because I have an old version of Pythonista (my iPad can only run iOS 5.1.1), but I have tested it on an iPod with the latest version of Pythonista. If anyone has any suggestions or bug reports, I'd be glad to hear them. Also, if anyone has any idea why it doesn't work on old Pythonista, I'd really appreciate help.
