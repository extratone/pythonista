# pythonista-youtubedl-downloader

## Note: I have decided to no longer support this project, I will be archiving this project in the near future.

Script to download [youtube-dl from main repo](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl), and patch it work in [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista) on iOS devices.

This script is not meant to download videos using youtube-dl but instead to download, backup, and restore youtube-dl itself.

It was inspired by https://github.com/HyShai/youtube-dl which you should check out if you want to understand how to use youtube-dl in Pythonista.
